I already have two React components: `EmployeeDashboard` and `ManagerDashboard` for a Smart Expense Approval System. They both have similar dashboard structures (sidebar, header, content area), but the code is duplicated.
 
Refactor the frontend to use a **shared layout component** called `DashboardLayout` that both dashboards can reuse, so the UI looks consistent and professional.
 
Requirements:
 
1. Create `DashboardLayout` component
- It should provide the overall page structure:
  - Left sidebar
  - Top header bar
  - Main content area
- Props:
  - `user` (object with name, role)
  - `navItems` (array of `{ id, label, icon?, onClick?, href? }`)
  - `activeNavId`
  - `onLogout` (function)
  - `children` (ReactNode for the specific dashboard content)
- Sidebar:
  - Show app logo/title: “Spend Desk”
  - Show nav items vertically, highlight the active one.
- Header:
  - Show current page title (can be passed as `pageTitle` prop or derived from active nav)
  - On the right: user name + avatar circle with initials, and Logout button.
- Main area:
  - Scrollable content area with light background.
  - Apply consistent padding and max width for content (like `max-w-6xl mx-auto` if using Tailwind).
 
2. Update EmployeeDashboard to use DashboardLayout
- Import and wrap all existing employee-specific content (summary cards, Create Expense form, My Expenses table) inside `DashboardLayout`.
- Pass:
  - `user` (employee user object)
  - `navItems` something like:
    - My Expenses
    - Create Expense
  - `activeNavId` based on which section is currently shown (you can keep it simple and just highlight “My Expenses” if there is no complex routing).
- Remove duplicated sidebar/header code from EmployeeDashboard and rely entirely on DashboardLayout.
 
3. Update ManagerDashboard to use DashboardLayout
- Do the same for ManagerDashboard:
  - Wrap content (summary cards, tabs, pending approvals table, history table) inside `DashboardLayout`.
  - `navItems` example:
    - Pending Approvals
    - History
  - `pageTitle` like “Manager Dashboard”.
- Again, remove duplicated layout code and rely only on DashboardLayout.
 
4. Styling and responsiveness
- Use the same design language and styles as before (Tailwind CSS if available):
  - Full-height flex layout (`min-h-screen`).
  - Fixed-width sidebar on the left (`w-64` on desktop), collapsible or full-width behavior on mobile.
  - Main content with background like `bg-slate-50` and white rounded cards inside.
- Ensure:
  - Sidebar and header look identical for both roles, only nav items + title differ.
  - Mobile view: sidebar can stack above content or allow horizontal scrolling if needed, but try to keep it usable in a small screen.
 
5. Code organization
- Put `DashboardLayout` in a separate file like `components/layout/DashboardLayout.jsx`.
- If you previously created reusable components like `StatCard`, `StatusBadge`, or `ConfirmModal`, leave them as-is but import them where needed.
- Make sure routing still works:
  - After login, EMPLOYEE goes to EmployeeDashboard using DashboardLayout.
  - MANAGER goes to ManagerDashboard using DashboardLayout.
 
6. Final touch
- Ensure there are no unused duplicated layout elements in EmployeeDashboard or ManagerDashboard.
- Add small polish:
  - Hover effects on nav items.
  - Subtle box-shadow on header and sidebar.
  - Smooth transitions on hover (`transition`, `duration-200` if Tailwind is available).
